/** *******************************************************************************
 * (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a           *
 * class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.          *
 * Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,            *
 * address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status         *
 * (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An  *
 * employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined   *
 * in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired.
 * A faculty    *
 * member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title.
 * Override the   *
 * toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name. *
 * Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program  *
 * that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes      *
 * their toString() methods.                                                      *
